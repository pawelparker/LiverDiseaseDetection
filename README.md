# LiverDiseaseDetection
This projects presents a Hybrid Model appraoch to detect liver disease. The hybrid model is built by stacking Artifical Neural Network(ANN) on top of Random Forest Classifier. Other models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic Regression have also been employed for contrasting the results obtained from  Hybrid model with these models

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project -Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) can be found at UCI machine learning respositry. The dataset consist of 583 instances and 11 features where 1 feature is a target label
