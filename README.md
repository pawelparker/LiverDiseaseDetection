# LiverDiseaseDetection
This projects presents a Hybrid Model appraoch to detect liver disease. The hybrid model is built by stacking different Artifical Neural Network(ANN) on top of Random Forest Classifier(meta-classifier). Other models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic Regression have also been employed for comparing the results.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project -Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) can be found at UCI machine learning respositry. The dataset consist of 583 instances and 11 features including a target label.
